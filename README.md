# WorkoutC
Is a Pebble Time watch app that lets you see the current duration of your workout as a percent rather than time left.

# Usage
```
Select - Start the timer
    Up - Stop the timer
  Down - Pause / Resume
```

# TODO
* Settings page with github pages
* Variable session length via the settings page
* Implement a confirm prompt for stopping so you don't stop on accident
* Make pausing persistant as well
* Rework the wake implementation
